     * This is a drawing area on which we shall draw a Life representation.
     *
     * Here some information on the canvas properties:
     *
     * 1. The drawing area has the origin set to the bottom left corner, with
     * positive `X` axis going to the right and positive `Y` axis going to
     * the top of the canvas.
     * 2. A pixel on the canvas has a square shape based on the pixel size
     * set when the canvas is instantiated.
     * 3. Because of 2, we have the `virtual` dimension (set by the client), 
     * and the `real` dimension, which is w * pixel_size by h * pixel_size.
     *
     * This class returns to the client an image (object) representation of the maze,
     * which might be recorded by the client as a PNG image file.
